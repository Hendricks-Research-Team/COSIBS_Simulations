simulation_functions.R: helper functions called by 'simulation_loop.Rmd', 'simulation_loop_2.Rmd', and 'simulation_loop_3.Rmd'.

The three 'simulation_loop_X.Rmd' files (and their knitted .html output): simulation results describing the ability of the PRS residualization approach to recapitulate latent structure. At time of writing (March 5, 2023), simulation loops 2 and 3 are current, original 'simulation_results.Rmd' is relatively out-of-date (although still accurate, to my knowledge).

white_regards.Rmd: application of the residualization approach to white subjects in REGARDS.

white_and_black_regards.Rmd: application of the residualization approach to white and black subjects in REGARDS.

white_and_black_regards_allTraits.Rmd: application of the residualization approach to white and black subjects in REGARDS, with an expanded set of phenotypes. As of 3/5/2023, this can be considered the most up-to-date real data application.
